Welcome to The Control System!

This system makes the entire control process much more easier.

## ðŸ“¦ Started [Local Mode](https://github.com/noamzuck/The-Control-System/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
  * Download [the zip file](https://github.com/noamzuck/The-Control-System/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of this repository and extract it.
  * Then open the 'index.html' file.

## ðŸš€ Usage
  * Open the folder 'Your Files'.
  * In the 'intro' folder you need to put your intro file. <b>Note that your intro file name must be 'intro.mp4'!</b>
  * In the 'vids' folder you should put all your videos. <b>Note that the format of all your videos must be '.mp4'!</b>
  * In the 'songs' folder you should create at least one folder with your songs (you can create two folders and then there will be a separation between the folders).
  
  <b>The three folders should look like the following example:<b>
  ```
